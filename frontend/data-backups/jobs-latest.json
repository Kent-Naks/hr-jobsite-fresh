Think of it as part detective work, part diplomacy.\n\nOur client values professionalism above all, so tone and persistence are just as important as speed. You’ll be trained on ageing analysis, posting credit notes, and escalating overdue accounts when necessary, giving you a solid grounding in real-world credit control. Every day brings small wins: a prompt payment, a grateful client, or an ageing report that finally balances perfectly. You’ll see the direct impact of your work on cash flow and team efficiency, which makes the role satisfying beyond just numbers on a screen.\n\nYou’ll also practice allocating receipts correctly, updating records in real-time, and tracking promises to pay. Little details like these prevent disputes, reduce errors, and build trust with both customers and internal stakeholders.\n\nPersistence is key. Some debts are easy to collect, others need gentle reminders over multiple calls and emails. This role teaches patience, tact, and how to stay firm without being harsh, a balancing act every credit controller needs.\n\nBy the time you’re comfortable, you’ll not only help the team hit targets but also develop skills that open doors to AR accounting and broader finance roles.

You’ll be stepping straight into that reality, where accuracy isn’t a preference; it’s the only way the numbers add up without drama.\n\nEach invoice you touch will force a bit of discipline: confirming the PO and GRN actually agree, spotting the VAT quirks suppliers sometimes slip in, and making sure every figure lines up before it ever reaches the payment list.

It’s work that rewards sharp eyes and a healthy respect for process. Then there’s the supplier side: updating statements, confirming balances, and responding to simple queries with clarity. Nothing glamorous, but essential if you want relationships to stay smooth and reconciliations to stop feeling like detective work.\n\nIf you like the idea of catching issues before they explode, enforcing structure where others get careless, and building real finance muscle from the ground up, this trainee role gives you exactly that, no fluff, no shortcuts, just solid AP foundations.\n\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n- Match invoices to POs/GRNs; check math & tax.\n- Route approvals; file vouchers; prepare payment lists.\n- Update supplier statements; answer simple queries.\n\nEducation & Experience:\n- Diploma in Accounting/Finance; CPA Part I is an advantage.\n- 0–1 year; ERP exposure a plus.\n\nSkills:\n- Excel basics, numeracy, document hygiene.\n\nKPIs:\n- On-time posting, zero duplicate payments, and audit readiness.\n\nCompensation:\nKES 52,000–75,000 base.

From color grading that conveys mood to sound polishing that sharpens impact, every detail counts. Managing proxies, backups, and project hygiene is as critical as assembling the perfect cut. A messy timeline is a timeline that kills creativity, so organization and foresight are part of your craft.\n\nLegal and rights considerations aren’t just paperwork; they’re part of the professional editor’s toolkit. Music licensing, footage releases, and proper clearances must be baked into your workflow. Your edits need to be ready for public distribution without a hitch, combining artistry with compliance in seamless balance.\n\nDeadlines here are real, but so is the satisfaction of seeing your work live, whether on festivals, streaming platforms, or branded campaigns. This role is perfect for someone who thrives in the rhythm of production cycles, loves problem-solving in post, and wants to see their vision translated into stories that resonate widely.\n\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n- Assemble rough cuts; refine pacing, structure, and story beats.\n- Color grading and sound polish with mixers/VO artists.\n- Manage proxies, storage, and backups; maintain project hygiene.\n- Clear rights (music/footage/releases) with producers.\n- Export masters and platform-specific deliverables.\n\nEducation & Experience:\n\n- Diploma or Bachelor's in Film/Media  + 4–6 yrs editing long-form.\n\nSkills & Tools:\n- Premiere/Resolve, audio sweetening basics, color workflow, storytelling.\n\nKPIs:\n- On-time delivery, client revisions, viewer retention curves, award shortlistings.\n\nCompensation (Kenya):\nKES 150,000–240,000 + project completion bonuses.\nComp is client-estimated and varies with reel quality, software depth, color/audio capability, and the complexity of deliverables. Big-name credits and festival selections can push offers higher.\n\nBenefits:\n- Medical, equipment/plug-in budget, training, flexible edit days.\n\nGrowth Path:\n- Senior Editor → Post Supervisor → Creative Director (Post).\nIdeal promotion cycle.",

In this role, you become the engineer who turns architectural sketches into environments that stay comfortable at 2 p.m. on a packed shopping day and at 7 a.m. when only cleaners are around. Loads, selections, duct routes, hydronics, you own the technical backbone that makes a building breathe properly.\n\nOn the sharper days, you’re deep in HAP models, testing assumptions, and balancing efficiency against capex. Other days you’re in ceiling voids, troubleshooting controls logic, explaining static pressure realities to contractors, and smoothing out the commissioning plan so TAB goes cleanly the first time. Your decisions ripple into utility bills, tenant satisfaction, and even future retrofit costs, so precision matters.\n\nExpect constant negotiation with architects and the broader MEP team, finding space for ducts that magically weren’t in the render, adjusting pipe runs, and keeping the acoustic footprint civilized. When commissioning time comes, you lead the dance: witness tests, trend logs, set-point policies, and the quiet pride of watching a system hit its comfort targets without energy waste.\n\nIf you enjoy the blend of design discipline, field practicality, and the diplomacy needed to make multiple parties align, this role puts you right in that sweet spot.

Your week revolves around maintaining clean models, disciplined file structures, and sheet sets that reflect current design intent with zero ambiguity. When engineers iterate, you update fast, document changes cleanly, and keep the CDE spotless.\n\nYou’ll run coordination views across trades, flag clashes early, and push timely RFIs that prevent downstream rework. Redlines are processed with precision, from line weights to annotations to tagging consistency. You’ll manage families, templates, and libraries so that modelling stays efficient and standards remain unbroken from project start to handover.\n\nThis role blends production speed with quality control; you’ll own naming conventions, sheet versioning, transmittal logs, and the small details that keep project teams aligned. Measured by sheet quality audits, RFI rates, and reissue cycles, your work directly influences how smoothly the site team executes.\n\nIdeal candidates bring 3–5 years in consultancy or contractor design offices, strong Revit/AutoCAD/ Navisworks capability, and the discipline to follow (and improve) BEP and CDE rules. Growth follows a clear path: Senior BIM Technician, BIM Coordinator, and ultimately Digital Delivery Lead.\n\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n- Draft structural/MEP drawings; maintain Revit/AutoCAD models.\n- Run coordination views; mark up clashes for engineers.\n- Manage sheets, tags, and families; follow BEP/CDE rules.\n- Process redlines quickly; issue transmittals with logs.\n- Keep libraries and templates tidy; train juniors.\n\nEducation & Experience:\n- Diploma in CAD/BIM/Eng Tech; 3–5 yrs consultancy/contractor office.\n\nSkills & Tools:\n- Revit, AutoCAD, Navisworks, CDEs, sheet standards.\n\nKPIs:\n- RFI rate, reissue cycles, sheet quality audits, and on-time submissions.\n\nCompensation (Kenya):\nKES 100,000–170,000 + annual bonus.\nClient estimates vary with software mastery.\n\nBenefits:\n- Medical, CPD, software license access, flexible days.\n\nGrowth Path: \n- Senior BIM Tech → BIM Coordinator → Digital Delivery Lead.\nIdeal promotion cycle.",

The culture is fast-paced but warm, data-driven but human. If you’ve got people skills, a calm head, and a soft spot for good office banter, you’ll fit right in. It’s not just HR, it’s HR with personality.\n\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n- Coordinate job postings, shortlist reviews, interview logistics, and offers.\n- Own onboarding: contracts, HRIS enrollment, induction agenda, 30/60/90 follow-ups.\n- Maintain personnel files, leave, and benefits; ensure statutory compliance.\n- Support performance cycles, training calendars, and probations.\n- Handle first-line employee relations and grievance intake; escalate appropriately.\n- Prepare HR dashboards (headcount, attrition, leave, time-to-hire).\n- Update policies/SOPs; brief managers on changes.\n- Partner with Payroll on monthly inputs and audits.\n\nEducation & Experience:\n- BCom (HR) / BA (PPM) or Diploma in HRM.\n- 2–3 years in HR generalist roles.\n\nSkills & Tools:\nHRIS (Bamboo/Zoho/Sage), Excel, labor law basics, confidentiality, and people skills.\n\nKPIs:\n- Time-to-hire, onboarding SLA, HRIS accuracy, and ER case turnaround.\n\nCompensation (Kenya):\nKES 70,000–120,000 + annual bonus (up to 10%).\nFigures are estimates shared by our clients and vary with your experience, interview performance, certifications, and company pay bands.\n\nBenefits:\n- Medical, pension, phone/data, training.\n\nGrowth Path (hierarchy/expected promotions):\n- Senior HR Officer → HR Business Partner → HR Manager.\nThis is the ideal hierarchy inside the client’s company and thus the expected growth cycle for this position.",
